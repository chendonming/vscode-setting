	// Place your snippets for vue-html here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"timeline": {
		"prefix": "tl",
		"body": [
			"<el-timeline>",
			"$0",
			"</el-timeline>"
		],
		"description": "element-ui 时间线"
	},
	"timelineItem": {
		"prefix": "tli",
		"body": [
			"<el-timeline-item timestamp=\"$1\">",
			"$0",
			"</el-timeline-item>",
		]
	}
